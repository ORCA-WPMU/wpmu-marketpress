WPMU marketpress whitelable for setting pages etc.

Hey everyone,

WPMU release good plugins, but some times in Multisite set-up 
we need to do filter things for Site Admin also as they are end-client for Multisite Environment
as subscriber in wordpress single site. 
and WPMU does not fully white-label by default, 
So i tweak few ui setting to make more better for thier users.

I could not get time to make gui for this, Just want to share with you , so you can take benefit of this.

using this file is very simple 

you have to put the file in "wp-content/mu-plugins/"  folder

if your wordpress wp-content folder does not have "mu-plugins" folder then you just create "mu-plugins" folder
and put this file in that folder. 

This file is completely safe, as it does not do any entry to database,
it does not alter any file or site structure 

Also no need to enable etc. 

Only when you want not to use this just delete or move this file to anywhere your system 

Hope in future i will create GUI panel as plugin for you, till then enjoy.
this.
