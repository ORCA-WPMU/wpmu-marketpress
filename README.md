WPMU marketpress whitelable for setting pages etc.

Hey everyone,

WPMU MarketPress White label  for setting pages etc.

<blockquote>Tested under wordpress multisite environment.

</blockquote>
WPMU release good plugins, but some times in Multisite set-up we need to do filter things for Site Admin also as they are end-client for Multisite Environment as subscriber in wordpress single site. and WPMU does not fully White label  by default, So i tweak few ui setting to make more better for their users.

I could not get time to make gui for this, Just want to share with you , so you can take benefit of this.

This mini plugin - removed "'User Capabilities" also from menu
as super admin not wanted to show this to site owners

<blockquote>using this file is very simple to use

</blockquote>
<blockquote>you have to put the file in "wp-content/mu-plugins/" folder

</blockquote>
if your wordpress wp-content folder does not have "mu-plugins" folder then you just create "mu-plugins" folder and put this file in that folder.

<blockquote>This file is completely safe, as it does not do any entry to database, it does not alter any file or site structure

</blockquote>
Also no need to enable etc.

Only when you want not to use this just delete or move this file to anywhere your system

Hope in future i will create GUI panel as plugin for you, till then enjoy. this. 

you can download from github or fork from following url:

</blockquote>
